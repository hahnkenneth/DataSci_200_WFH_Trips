The link to download the full datasets that we used is below:
  - Trips Data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BpmdBsZB2i6Qi9eV_ssBfUB3kV1eK4Nu/view?usp=sharing
  - Remote Work Data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qhz-6X1OX7USYtbMzWCzG-2smkmITmUa/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115172048637575273970&rtpof=true&sd=true

We run merge_wfh_trips_data.py to merge the two datasets above and output two merged dataframes. One of the dataframes is looking at the state level and the other data frame is on the national level.
These two merged datasets are tracked on a monthly basis:
  - National Level Merged Data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17WEtyrVy6KvMMNdagU0K3pGOGsdi5hM-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115172048637575273970&rtpof=true&sd=true
  - State Level Merged Datahttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WxmcHE_aRLspZ_75O4P18c8HR31u3_36/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115172048637575273970&rtpof=true&sd=true

plot_heatmaps_and_trends.py gets the merged datasets directly from the merge_wfh_trips_data.py module and outputs many different plots that are used in our final report including the choropleths, bar charts
scatter plots, and box plots.

Plot_State.py gets the merged datasets from the merged data in the excel files linked above and outputs important time trend plots by state using a function to quickly create plots based on the state
of interest.
